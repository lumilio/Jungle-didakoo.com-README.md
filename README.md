## Animals 
This game is 1 vs 1. To win, one player must move any animal from his team <!-- ? -->to the piramid of the opponent. Each player has 8 different animals, with different degrees of power. The initial animals arrangement in board is random for each player every new match.

Here are the animals pieces, with their relative powers indicated by number :

&ensp;

## Movement of the Animals
All animals have the same basic move, although some have extra moves. The basic move is just one space either forward, backward, left or right. The animals never move diagonally. An animal is eaten by an opposing animal moving onto its square. The attacking animal must be of equal or higher power than the one being eaten.

### Extra moves
1) The Rat, although it is the least powerful piece, has the power to capture the Elephant. The Elephant can not capture the Rat. 
2) The Rat, and no other animal, can move in the water. 
3) Both the Lion and the Tiger can jump over the water, moving from one bank straight forward, backward, left or right to the first square of dry land on the other side. They may capture in this move as well. The Lion and Tiger can not jump over a rat if in the water.

&ensp;

## The Trees <img src="https://imgur.com/HJTKsI7.jpg" alt="drawing" style=""/> 

Each side has 3x Tree squares surrounding its Piramid. A player may move on and off of his own tree squares with no effect. If, however, a player moves onto the opponent’s tree square, that piece loses all of its power, and may be eaten by any of the defending pieces.

## The Piramid

Animals are not allowed to move into their own Piramid. When an animal moves into the opponent’s Piramid, it has won the game.

## Ethereum & L2 Blockchains

[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) is a distributed computing platform based on [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) technology. Ethereum enables the execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications in a secure environment without the need for a central authority.

The introduction of Ethereum NFTs has allowed didakoo.com to recognize players and their NFTs without requiring an email or password. This is done through the use of crypto wallet [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), which provides a unique blockchain address that proves ownership of the player's NFTs. With Metamask you can create infinite anonymous wallets and addresses for free. 

L2 are independent blockchains connected to Ethereum. Didakoo.com allows you to Log-in using Metamask on the following chains:

* [Ethereum Mainnet](https://metamask.io/)
* [Polygon (L2)](https://metamask.io/)
* [Base (L2)](https://metamask.io/)

&ensp;

## How to login

![Imgur Image](http://i.imgur.com/5RQD9sA.jpg)

You can Login with Metamask wallet or as “no wallet”. If you participate as “no wallet” there is no signature request and you are not able to create or use your avatar. You can login as "no wallet" even in incognito mode in your browser.

![Imgur Image](http://i.imgur.com/prdR0xK.jpg)

In didakoo.com, MetaMask login is done through the signature of a message (a random nonce) to authenticate wallet ownership. This signature does not require any on-chain transactions and has zero gas fees. You can connect a fresh wallet without worrying about transaction costs or exposing your main account. The login process works on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon or Base networks.
