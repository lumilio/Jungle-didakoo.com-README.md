## Animals 
This game is 1 vs 1. To win, one player must move any animal from his team to the piramid of the opponent. Each player has 8 different animals, with different degrees of power. The initial animals arrangement in board is random for each player every new match.

Here are the animals pieces, with their relative powers indicated by number :

&ensp;

## Movement of the Animals
All animals have the same basic move, although some have extra moves. The basic move is just one space either forward, backward, left or right. The animals never move diagonally. An animal is eaten by an opposing animal moving on its square. The attacking animal must be equal or higher power than the one being eaten.

### Extra moves
1) The Rat has the power to capture the Elephant. The Elephant can not capture the Rat. 
2) The Rat, and no other animal, can move in the water. 
3) Both the Lion and the Tiger can jump over the water, moving from one bank straight forward, backward, left or right to the first square of dry land on the other side. They may capture in this move as well. The Lion and Tiger can not jump over a rat if in the water.

&ensp;

## The Trees <img src="https://imgur.com/HJTKsI7.jpg" alt="drawing" style=""/> 

Each side has 3x Tree squares surrounding its Piramid. A player may move on and off of his own tree squares with no effect. If, however, a player moves on the opponent’s tree square, that piece loses all of its power, and may be eaten by any of the defending pieces.

## The Piramid

Animals are not allowed to move on their own Piramid. When an animal moves into the opponent’s Piramid, it has won the game.

## Ethereum & L2 Blockchains

[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) is a distributed computing platform based on [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) technology. Ethereum enables the execution of <!-- smart contracts and -->decentralized applications in a secure environment.<!--  without a central authority -->

You don’t need to use Ethereum if you play without your Avatar. However, if you want access to more features, you can create your avatar using a [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) crypto wallet. MetaMask provides a unique blockchain address that proves ownership of your in-game item NFTs. You can create unlimited anonymous wallets and addresses for free. In the next section [How to login](https://github.com/lumilio/Jungle-didakoo.com-README.md?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-login) you will find a tutorial.

L2 are independent blockchains connected to Ethereum. Didakoo.com allows you to Log-in using Metamask on the following chains:

* [Ethereum Mainnet](https://ethereum.org/en/)
* [Polygon (L2)](https://polygon.technology/)
* [Base (L2)](https://www.base.org/)

&ensp;

## How to login

![Imgur Image](http://i.imgur.com/5RQD9sA.jpg)

You can Log-in with Metamask wallet or as “no wallet”. If you participate as “no wallet” there is no signature request and you are not able to create or use your avatar. You can Log-in as "no wallet" even in incognito mode in your browser.

![Imgur Image](http://i.imgur.com/prdR0xK.jpg)

In didakoo.com, MetaMask Log-in is done through the signature of a message (a random nonce) to authenticate wallet ownership. This signature does not require any on-chain transactions and has zero gas fees. You can connect a fresh wallet without worrying about transaction costs or exposing your main account. The Log-in process works on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon or Base networks. <!-- If using Metamask don't share your secret phrase with anyone. -->
