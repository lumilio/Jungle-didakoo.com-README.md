This game is 1 vs 1. To win, one player must successfully move any animal to the Castle of the opponent.

## Animals Pieces
Each player has eight pieces, different animals, with different degrees of power. Here are the pieces, their English names, and their relative powers, indicated by number:

1) Rat
2) Cat
3) Dog
4) Monkey
5) Leopard
6) Tiger
7) Lion
8) Elephant 

## Movement of the Pieces
All pieces have the same basic move, although some have special powers (described below). The basic move is just one space either forward, backward, left or right. The pieces never move diagonally. An animal is captured (or “eaten”) by an opposing animal moving onto its square, as in chess. But the attacking animal must be of equal or higher power than the one being captured. For instance, the Tiger (6) can capture the Tiger (6), Leopard (5) or Monkey (4), but the Dog can not capture the Leopard or Tiger.

## Extra moves
1) The Rat, although it is the least powerful piece, has the power to capture the Elephant. The Elephant can not capture the Rat. 
2) The Rat, and no other animal, can move in the water. 
3) Both the Lion and the Tiger can jump over the water, moving from one bank straight forward, backward, left or right to the first square of dry land on the other side. They may capture in this move as well. The Lion and Tiger can not jump over a rat if in the water.


## The Castle
Animals are allowed to move into their own Castle. When an animal moves into the opponent’s Castle, it has won the game.

## The Trees
Each side has three Tree squares surrounding its Castle. A player may move on and off of his own Tree squares with no effect. If, however, a player moves onto the opponent’s tree square, that piece loses all of its power, and may be captured by any of the defending pieces.

## Rank & Points
At the end of a match the winner is rewarded with 3 rank points. ...........

## Game modes
You can play against computer or challenge a friend in Multiplayer mode by sharing a room link.

## App Code is private 
Single-Page WebApp Multiplyer Videogame with custom minimax algorithm built in Laravel (PHP) and Vue.js (JavaScript). 
After a careful evaluation of potential risks that could harm both Didakoo brand and its customers, I have decided to make the GitHub repository containing the game’s code private. This decision stems from the need to safeguard intellectual property, maintain quality control, and ensure a safety user experience. One of the primary concerns is that malicious actors could copy the code to create fraudulent versions of the game, 
potentially using them for phishing scams. Such replicas could deceive users into providing sensitive information, 
putting both their data and the reputation of the Didakoo brand at risk. By restricting access to the code, 
I aim to prevent these threats and protect our customers from harmful exploitation. 
This measure ensures that only authorized contributors have access, 
allowing us to deliver a secure and authentic software.
