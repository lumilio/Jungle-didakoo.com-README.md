## Animals 
This is a 1 vs 1 game. To win, a player must move one of their animals to the opponent's pyramid. 

Each player has 8 different animals, each with a different power level. The starting position of the animals is random for each player every new match. Here are the animals, with their relative power levels indicated by numbers :

&ensp;

## Movement of the Animals
All animals can move one space forward, backward, left, or right. Animals cannot move diagonally. An animal is eaten by an opposing animal moving on its square. The attacking animal must be equal or higher power than the one being eaten. Some animals have extra moves.

### Extra moves
1) The Rat has the power to capture the Elephant. The Elephant can not capture the Rat. 
2) The Rat, and no other animal, can move in the water. 
3) The Lion and Tiger can jump over water, but they cannot if there is a Rat in the water.

&ensp;

## Plants <img src="https://imgur.com/HJTKsI7.jpg" alt="drawing" style=""/>

Each player has 3 x Plant squares around their Pyramid. Animals can move on and off their own plants with no effect. If, however, an animal moves on the opponent’s plant , that animal loses all of its power, and may be eaten by any of the defending animals.

## Pyramids

Animals are not allowed to move on their own pyramid. When an animal moves into the opponent’s pyramid, it has won the game.

## How to login

If you participate as “no wallet” there is no signature request and you are not able to create or use your avatar. You can play as "no wallet" even in incognito mode in your browser. 

MetaMask Log-in is done through the signature of a message (a random nonce) to authenticate wallet ownership. This signature does not require any on-chain transactions and has zero gas fees. You can connect a fresh wallet without worrying about transaction costs or exposing your main account. The Log-in process works on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon or Base networks. If using Metamask don't share your secret phrase with anyone.
