After a careful evaluation of potential risks that could harm both Didakoo brand and its customers, 
I have decided to make the GitHub repository containing the gameâ€™s code private. 
This decision stems from the need to safeguard intellectual property, 
maintain quality control, and ensure a secure experience for users.

One of the primary concerns is that malicious actors could copy the code to create fraudulent versions of the game, 
potentially using them for phishing scams. Such replicas could deceive users into providing sensitive information, 
putting both their data and the reputation of the Didakoo brand at risk. By restricting access to the code, 
I aim to prevent these threats and protect our customers from harmful exploitation. 
This measure ensures that only authorized contributors have access, 
allowing us to deliver a reliable, secure, and authentic product experience.
